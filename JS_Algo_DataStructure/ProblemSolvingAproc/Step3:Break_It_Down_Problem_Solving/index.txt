BREAK IT DOWN
1. Explicityly write out the steps you need to take.
        -------> it's forcing you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any.
        lingering conceptional issue or misunderstandings before u dive in and have to worry about details as well.


Examples;
    function charCount(str) {
            // make object to return at end
            // loop over string, for each character...
            // if character is number/letter AND a key of object update count one,
            // if character is number/letter not a key set key with a 1 value,
            // if character is something else (space, priod, etc.) don't do anything
        return object at end
    }
