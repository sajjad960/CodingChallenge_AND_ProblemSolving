Main Part is!

Understand the problem.
-----------------------------
1.Can I restate the problem with my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem!
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem.
4. Input can make the outputs successfully? Or Do I have enough information to solve the problem? (if possible think about this question, otherwise move);
5. How should I label the important piesces of data that are a part of the problem.

----> A example
Write a function which takes two numbers and returs their sum.
1. "Implement adition"
2. Input goes to the the problem is two number (like intiger or Floating number). {
    i. what happen for big or large number (JS gives infinity);
    ii. What happen if someOne put more input than two input
    iii. what about the string
}
3. what's the output ? (int, float ? string ?)
4. What happen if a input missing ?
5.
